# NOTE-APP Project

An application used to add, edit and delete notes, built with vanila JavaScript, and CSS.

### Reflection

-Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to creat notes and manage them in any time.

I used vanilla JS and Css for building this project.
